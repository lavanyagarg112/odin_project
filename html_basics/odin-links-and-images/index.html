    <!-- the noreferrer prevents the opened link from knowing which webpage has a link to it, includes the noopener behaviour
    and thus can be used by itself -->

    <!-- noopener prevents phishing attacks - where the opened link may redirect to another link to trick users

        HTML document without being encoded. -->

    <!-- Entities always begin with an ampersand (&) and end with a semicolon (;). 
        In between, you put a special code that your browser will interpret as a symbol. 
        In this case, it interprets lt, gt, and amp as less-than, greater-than, and ampersand symbols, respectively. -->
